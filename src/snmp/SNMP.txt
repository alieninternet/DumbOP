SNMP reference

implementation should be SNMPv1. Reason is that this is the most common
version, everything can use it and the MIB files, and it makes the
implementation easier. Although SNMPv1 does not include special
authentication routines like SNMPv2, SNMPv1 can be accessed in a secure mode
via an SNMPv2 (which can act like a proxy) which can give security. The
server doesn't block certain IP addresses, so it shouldn't have to
authenticate SNMP connections either. In the future it may be necessary to
add SNMPv2 & SNMPv3 support (v3 is a combination of 1 and 2 with more features)

enterprises is defined as .1.3.6.1.4.1 (from root)
alien internet services (ais) is defined as 4379 under 'enterprises'
game software (games) is defined as '2' under our pen
evolution (egs) is defined as '1' under 'games'

(dod-arpa iana ais pen? confused? hehehe :)

the sub sub subsubsubsubsubsubsubsubsubsubsubsubsub groups are used to allow
flexibility in the future. Eg. game software, so we can have categories.
What if we develop more game software later? What if we suddenly become a
hardware company that develops large rack-mountable boxes with flashing
lights that have snmp capability (yeah, I wish ;) etc etc etc

The tree under evolution is then split up further, into components of
software, like the server, the relay etc. Under that there some generic and
specific categories that I will go into later.

object types: 
	INTEGER - 32bit number (generic, signed)
		note, an enumerated integer of value '0' is excluded in 
		a list of enumerations as it is invalid and is apparently
		prohibited.
	OCTET STRING - string of 8-bit 'chars' (char array)
	OBJECT IDENTIFIER - an OID reference
	NULL - nothing.
	SEQUENCE (type1, type2, ...typeN) - sequence of types (structure)
	NetworkAddress - inaddr address, but could be any type ('CHOICE')
	IpAddress - ('OCTET STRING' length 4)
	Counter - 32-bit number (unsigned) that only increments
		note, it is allowed to overflow, obviously resetting it from
		0. It is defined as 2^32-1 (4294967295 decimal) in rfc1065.
	Guage - 32-bit number (unsigned) that can float, but gets latched at
		peak (4294967295), therefore cannot overflow (or 'overfloat')
	TimeTicks - 32-bit integer (unsigned) that counts time in 100ths of
		a second. This object identifies the reference from epoch.
	(there are more.. I am lazy)
