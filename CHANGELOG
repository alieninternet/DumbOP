Version 0.34
------------
Pickle: ctcp.cc - Fixed bug that was causing IRC servers to get cranky with
	CTCP TIME reply, and clients to get confused between it and a NOTICE.
Pickle: ansi.cc - Fixed top bar code time display; Now uses ctime().
Pickle: Converted numerous time(NULL)'s to use the Bot::currentTime structure
	set in the main loop to reduce number of system calls.
Pickle: utils.cc - Added replaceVowels function
Pickle: utils.cc - Added reverseStr function
Pickle: ansi.cc - Added toANSI function, now using it with TelnetSpy::
	routines.
Pickle: signal.cc - Rough signal code added. Bot will shut down properly upon
	death signals. No support for rehashing via SIGHUP as yet. All other
	superfluous signals ignored. Did I mention 'rough'? hehe :)
Pickle: bot.cc - Changed PING/PONG to only send a string rather than
	waste time referencing memory to get the time. We no longer depend on
	the server reply. AustNET returns a traditional PING (everything sent),
	traditional IRCd returns just the PINGer's nick name. Many networks
	send out either their network name, the options previously mentioned
	or other strings. The RFC's from 2000 tell us the PING data should
	contain the origin. We are going to be technically correct now, but
	in the real world we just cannot rely on it, obviously! :)
Pickle: gamequiz.cc and gamequiz.h created
Pickle: INFO merged into STATS command (dodgey!)
Pickle: MSG command removed
Pickle: CATEGORY command created for quiz game (sketchy so far)
Pickle: bot.cc: Moved receivedLen and sentLen into ServerConnection class
Pickle: serverqueue.cc: Finally added the incrementor for sentLen!!!
Pickle: HINT and REPEAT quiz commands created (shells)
Pickle: telnetspy.cc: Fixed 'bug' (rather, oversight) where signoff messages
	were devoid of their first word.
Pickle: channel.cc: Fixed bug with reading data from the file. It appears I
	neglected a field, which made everything after the mode/topic locks
	off-alignment and causes a slight inconvenience with the flagging
	system. Channel list files should still be replaced with something
	better though, right?


Version 0.33
------------
Pickle: parser.cc - Fixed retarded bug that shouldn't have happened in the
	first place. The bug stopped the bot being hear on channels.
Pickle: Removed 'BEEP' command. It's purpose was both obscure and quite
	useless in many respects other than there to shit people up the wall.
Pickle:	Restricted 'SAY' and 'DO' commands tightly, and removed spoof-breaking
	output (the hidden <=- alias at the end, and the '%%' prefix.)
Pickle: Channels are now read from a separate file, default to bot.channels.
	This now allows for greater flexibility, saving list files etc.
Pickle: bot.cc - Changed currentTime into a structure fit for ftime(). This
	allows for more precise timings to be calculated including millisecond
	length lag checks and ping replies.
Pickle: Various time(NULL) commands have now been replaced with pointers to
	to the existing time(NULL) point found in the Bot::currentTime
	structure. This is more efficient use, using memory instead of a
	system call.
Pickle: Added "PING" command; Ping reply uses the above timing routine to
	provide the user with a highly accurate lag response.
Pickle: parser.cc - Removed CTCP restriction to be destined for users only
	and not channels. The specifications do not specificially mention
	whether or not it is allowed to work in a channel broadcast form. Most
	modern IRC clients, including ircII these days, do allow this which
	allows people who are voiced to CTCP the entire channel. This is most
	likely because most modern servers parse CTCP these days and do 
	restrict channel CTCP's to voiced users within that channel only.
	Hopefully the IRC-3 specs will make this manditory so we can leave it
	like that, because it's kinda handy.


Version 0.32
------------
Pickle: ctcp.cc - Ok, so DumbOP wasn't that compliant afterall. The TIME
	command has been made compliant.
Pickle: ctcp.cc - ECHO command added. _NOW_ we're fully compliant!! :)
Pickle: bot.h - Lag counter PING_TIME changed again from 5 mins to 90 secs
Pickle: bot.h - The non-pinging pinger now pings... :)
Pickle: Makefile - Added stripping to the main MAKE loop. To make a debug-able
	compile, run "make debug", otherwise enjoy the savings :)
Pickle: notelist.cc and notelist.h created, working in list style similar to
	the userlist functions.
Pickle: ansi.h and ansi.cc - updated to conform just above standards (output)
Pickle: bot.cc - Changed ping so that instead of just pinging with PING_TIME
	seconds of inactivity instead of pinging every PING_TIME secs when
	there's no activity on the server. This ensures the lag counter is
	always current within PING_TIME secs. This also seems to stop 
	anti-spoof servers constantly running checks on the DumbOP host.
Pickle: signal.cc & signal.h created - Proper signal handling can now be done. 
Pickle: config.cc & config.h created - Ready for new config format and
	multiple server connections.
Pickle: telnetspy.c - IRCtoANSI added, and does nice TG style ircII conversion


Version 0.31
------------
Pickle: bot.h - Changed server lag counter PING length from 90 secs to 5 mins
Pickle: flags.c created! An enormously ugly flag lookup table has been made
Pickle: ctcp.c and ctcp.h created - CTCP commands have been moved here and
	are executed similar to usercommands.c. The CTCP responce code was
	starting to get a little over the top.
	!!! DUMBOP IS READY TO BE THE MOST CTCP COMPLIANT CLIENT AVAILABLE !!!
	(Better than that bloody eggdrop pile of crap.. Heh heh heh! AND
	 even better than mIRC and ircII. I'm personally impressed! :)
Pickle: dccparser.c & dccparser.h have both been deleted due to the new CTCP
	layout.
Pickle: note.c and note.h created - NOTE command has been added, linking into
	note.c, codebase creation has begin, although cannot really be
	implemented until the database code is finalised and in place.
Pickle: ansi.c, ansi.h, telnet.c, telnet.h, telnetspy.c, telnetspy.h added -
	Ready for the ability to telnet to DumbOP for off-relay maintenance 
	stuff.
Pickle: games.c and games.h created - Implementation of gaming code can begin.
	Game flags from flags.c/flags.h have been moved into their new home.
Pickle: DumbOP now has a bit of the TG smell to it :)
Pickle: version.h and version.c created, version information scattered across
	the files has been moved here now, including the INFO command from 
	usercommands.c
Pickle: parser.c - NULL pointers that might have been followed accidentally
	in loops have been removed.
Pickle: bot.c - Added some debugging output to the init/deinit functions


Version 0.30
------------
Pickle: CHANGELOG created.. DumbOP is now quite the real UNIX production :)
Pickle: Started to add comments in front of commands in usercommands.c.
	Format should probably start to become a standard, as follows in
       	semi-BNF:
	/* <FunctionName> - <Description>
	 * Original <date>, <who> <e-mail address>
	 * <date> <who> - <change made>
	   ...
	 * Needs: <required future modifications>
	   ...
	 */
Pickle: Removed Tkick
Pickle: DumbOP password moved to bot.h as a define (parser.c changed)
Pickle: Changed default nick change time from 1 min to 10 mins
Pickle: bot.c - Added nickop identification after retry wantedNickname attempt
