Version 0.32
------------
Pickle: ctcp.cc - Ok, so DumbOP wasn't that compliant afterall. The TIME
	command has been made compliant.
Pickle: ctcp.cc - ECHO command added. _NOW_ we're fully compliant!! :)
Pickle: bot.h - Lag counter PING_TIME changed again from 5 mins to 90 secs
Pickle: bot.h - The non-pinging pinger now pings... :)
Pickle: Makefile - Added stripping to the main MAKE loop. To make a debug-able
	compile, run "make debug", otherwise enjoy the savings :)
Pickle: notelist.cc and notelist.h created, working in list style similar to
	the userlist functions.
Pickle: ansi.h and ansi.cc - updated to conform just above standards (output)
Pickle: bot.cc - Changed ping so that instead of just pinging with PING_TIME
	seconds of inactivity instead of pinging every PING_TIME secs when
	there's no activity on the server. This ensures the lag counter is
	always current within PING_TIME secs. This also seems to stop 
	anti-spoof servers constantly running checks on the DumbOP host.
Pickle: signal.cc & signal.h created - Proper signal handling can now be done. 
Pickle: config.cc & config.h created - Ready for new config format and
	multiple server connections.
Pickle: telnetspy.c - IRCtoANSI added, and does nice TG style ircII conversion


Version 0.31
------------
Pickle: bot.h - Changed server lag counter PING length from 90 secs to 5 mins
Pickle: flags.c created! An enormously ugly flag lookup table has been made
Pickle: ctcp.c and ctcp.h created - CTCP commands have been moved here and
	are executed similar to usercommands.c. The CTCP responce code was
	starting to get a little over the top.
	!!! DUMBOP IS READY TO BE THE MOST CTCP COMPLIANT CLIENT AVAILABLE !!!
	(Better than that bloody eggdrop pile of crap.. Heh heh heh! AND
	 even better than mIRC and ircII. I'm personally impressed! :)
Pickle: dccparser.c & dccparser.h have both been deleted due to the new CTCP
	layout.
Pickle: note.c and note.h created - NOTE command has been added, linking into
	note.c, codebase creation has begin, although cannot really be
	implemented until the database code is finalised and in place.
Pickle: ansi.c, ansi.h, telnet.c, telnet.h, telnetspy.c, telnetspy.h added -
	Ready for the ability to telnet to DumbOP for off-relay maintenance 
	stuff.
Pickle: games.c and games.h created - Implementation of gaming code can begin.
	Game flags from flags.c/flags.h have been moved into their new home.
Pickle: DumbOP now has a bit of the TG smell to it :)
Pickle: version.h and version.c created, version information scattered across
	the files has been moved here now, including the INFO command from 
	usercommands.c
Pickle: parser.c - NULL pointers that might have been followed accidentally
	in loops have been removed.
Pickle: bot.c - Added some debugging output to the init/deinit functions


Version 0.30
------------
Pickle: CHANGELOG created.. DumbOP is now quite the real UNIX production :)
Pickle: Started to add comments in front of commands in usercommands.c.
	Format should probably start to become a standard, as follows in
       	semi-BNF:
	/* <FunctionName> - <Description>
	 * Original <date>, <who> <e-mail address>
	 * <date> <who> - <change made>
	   ...
	 * Needs: <required future modifications>
	   ...
	 */
Pickle: Removed Tkick
Pickle: DumbOP password moved to bot.h as a define (parser.c changed)
Pickle: Changed default nick change time from 1 min to 10 mins
Pickle: bot.c - Added nickop identification after retry wantedNickname attempt
