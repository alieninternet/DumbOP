Hi.

This version of DumbOP is *NOT* mature software!

To compile, you will first need to run 'configure'.

Before you do, you may be interested in these:

Turn on internal and GDB debugging:
> export CXXFLAGS="-g -DDEBUG"

Optomise but leave internal debugging on:
> export CXXFLAGS="-O2 -DDEBUG"

Warning!! Using the -g flag will cause dumbop's compile to be HUGE... At
last count after a compilation it chewed up around 190 meg of space, producing
a binary around 7 meg in size -- use this -g thing with caution :)

Otherwise configure will default to just -O2, and you miss out on the
luxury of being able to find a bug :) Without the DEBUG define you will not
be able to use the -D command.

Also, a little note to myself here, to find the biggest .cc file:
> ls -l `find . -name \\*.cc` |sort |less
