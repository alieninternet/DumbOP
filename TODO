Change over to GDBM Databases. Channel Masks should be removed and replaced
with references to channel database entries as to make it act more like
ChanOP, and to remove multiple user entries.

Users should be able to add themselves to DumbOP.

PASSWORD CODE! Change password needs fixing, crypt fucked?

Ban lists - Should be better than ChanOP - check every nick change and join
against banlist masks, so that DumbOP can properly ban name!*@* like ChanOP
is incapable of.. (Cheeky`louise!*@* would be handy in #melbrave :)

Command Counter

ChanOP resync

Add !ping

Finish !lastseen (mask searching, channel mask searching)

Finish !access (mask searching, channel mask searching)

Tban+Tkban+ban+kick merge

Combine !server and !serverlist, !nextserver and !reconnect

Add command to force nickop/other bot identification

Move channel list to a file (Add save/load channel list commands, peak saving)

Finish !beep

Finish !names (- returns all; should only return channels user has access to)

Finish parse command (shouldn't require ! on direct privmsgs)

Convert old flag code to use the new flags (FINALLY)

Add channel flag (long int) to channel entries

Add channel protection shit (see flags.h)

Add channel logging [24hr e-mail log to channel owner(s)]??

Remove the "add dumbop to userlist" bugfix in parser.c

Add flag table, flag command, flag, flag chr, flags name (one table for chan, one for users)

Fix utils::flagToStr for the new flag table (above)

Add setuser and setchan flag manipulation commands

Fix formatting in old ripped commands to suit new format

Use "ISON" irc command (rfc 1459) to check for bot-users online

Add bot-authentication strings to userlist file (replace old prot variable spot)

Move hard-coded nickop authentication to userlist file (above)

Add cnx->bot->sendLen += to output, where appropriate (most likely in serverqueue.c)

Add signal checking code (maybe rip the old code from the gathering project) 
to minimise hard crashes and panic race modes

Game code bed should be completed

Much better logging code needs to be implemented with levels, zones etc.
This will require a log.c and log.h file
