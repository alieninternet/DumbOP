# Zany!! 810 star trek questions all from til!! :-/
#
# The hitch hiker's guide questions were not complete (no answers)... :(
#
# But still.. 810! These need editing, plenty of multiple answer stuff
# (mainly the answers need checking over, lots of weird references etc etc)
#
# Still, brilliant job from TIL, he compiled these himself I gather.. eek! :)
#
# Looks like we have another question writer - he's got more he's going to
# write. Sorry, no numbers in this one - this file was so easy to convert
# I wrote a little script to do it instead of modifying my ripping program..
#
# Enjoy!
